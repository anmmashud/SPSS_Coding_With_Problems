# SPSS Coding with Problems

This repository contains SPSS solutions for a variety of statistical problems. Each problem is organized into a dedicated folder containing data files, syntax files, and output files to make the workflow reproducible and easy to follow.

## Project Overview
The goal of this repository is to:
- Solve statistical problems using SPSS.
- Provide a clear structure for data (`.sav`), syntax (`.sps`), and output (`.spv`) files.
- Serve as a reference for learning and applying SPSS in research and analytics.

## File Structure
The repository follows this structure:

```plaintext
SPSS_Coding_With_Problems/
├── SPSS_Coding_with_Problems.pdf	# Original problem description document
├── Problem_1/
│   ├── 1_Problem_1.sav        		# Data file for Problem 1
│   ├── 2_Syntax_problem_1.sps  	# Syntax file for Problem 1
│   ├── 3_Output_problem_1.spv  	# Output file for Problem 1
├── Problem_2/
│   ├── 1_Problem_2.sav         	# Data file for Problem 2
│   ├── 2_Syntax_problem_2.sps   	# Syntax file for Problem 2
│   ├── 3_Output_problem_2.spv   	# Output file for Problem 2
├── Problem_3/
│   ├── 1_Problem_3.sav         	# Data file for Problem 3
│   ├── 2_Syntax_problem_3.sps  	 	# Syntax file for Problem 3
│   ├── 3_Output_problem_3.spv   	# Output file for Problem 3
├── Problem_4/
│   ├── 1_Problem_4.sav        		# Data file for Problem 4
│   ├── 2_Syntax_problem_4.sps   	# Syntax file for Problem 4
│   ├── 3_Output_problem_4.spv   	# Output file for Problem 4
├── .gitattributes              	# Git configuration for handling line endings
├── LICENSE                     	# License for the repository
├── README.md                    	# Project overview and file structure
```

## Naming Convention

Each file serves a specific purpose:
- `1_Problem_X.sav`: Data file containing the dataset for the problem.
- `2_Syntax_problem_X.sps`: Syntax file with SPSS commands to solve the problem.
- `3_Output_problem_X.spv`: Output file with the results of executing the syntax.

---

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the folder for the specific problem.
2. Open the `.sav` file in SPSS to explore the data.
3. Load and execute the `.sps` syntax file in SPSS to generate the results.
4. Review the `.spv` output file for the solution.
